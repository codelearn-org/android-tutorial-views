In the previous level, we created a new Android project: **CodelearnLiftApp**.

## Designing the basic layout

The app should now have MainActivity as the initial screen. We need to design the basic layout for MainAcitivty in it's corresponding layout file, **main_acitivity.xml**.


##Tasks

1. Create two blank activites called **CreateCarpoolActivity** and **CarpoolListActivity.**
2. Create two buttons in the MainActivity layout with ids, **R.id.create** and **R.id.skip** which launch intents to the **CreateCarpoolActivity** and **CarpoolListActivity**, correspondingly.
